3. Replace the following line in your HTML with your key:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="your-access-key">
```
## 🚫 Anti-Inspect (Basic)

This project includes basic methods to discourage source code inspection:

- Disabled **right-click** context menu  
- Blocked keyboard shortcuts:
  - `F12`
  - `Ctrl + Shift + I`
  - `Ctrl + Shift + J`
  - `Ctrl + U`

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is not foolproof and only provides minimal deterrence.
